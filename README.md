###What is it?
A simple Neural Network Implementation using R.

###What are the Packages used?
1. neuralnet.
2. GRID.
3. Mass.

###From did I learn it?
1.For the math and theory, I read from Christian Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning.[PDF here.](http://www.rmki.kfki.hu/~banmi/elte/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20and%20Machine%20Learning.pdf)
2.For the implementation, I used [this website](http://gekkoquant.com/2012/05/26/neural-networks-with-r-simple-example/)
